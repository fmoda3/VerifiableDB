This is the Demo for the VerifiableDB Django project.
It uses the django admin page and two apps "bank" and "evil"

* Start the server:
	
	python manage.py runserver
	
* In one browser window navigate to localhost:8000/admin/bank
* In another browser window navigate to localhost:8000/admin/evil
* login
 	username 'demo'
 	password 'hashtree'

The demo uses the hash chaining implementation as well as the MACing scheme (verifying completeness and integrity)

* In the first window (we'll refer to it as bank in the future) click 'Verifiable members'
* Add a verifiable member in bank and click Save
* Select the verifiable member and notice that the field data_hash has been updated and go back to the previous page

* In the second window (we'll refer to it as evil in the future) click 'Members'
* Select the member created in bank
* Change the field 'Balance' and click Save

* Again Select the verifiable member in bank and an error should pop up on the screen
* Navigate back to the previous page

* Change the field 'Balance' in evil back to the correct balance and repeat the two previous steps (this time no error should occur)


The previous was a basic demonstration of integrity verification in order to demonstrate completeness:
	* Create several new verifiable members in bank
	* Edit the data of one or more member in evil
	* Select one of the filters in bank
